# Random City Map Generator

This Java application generates a random map of 100 cities, with roads connecting them, and visualizes the map using GraphStream. The cities have randomly assigned names, latitude, and longitude values. Roads between cities are categorized into different types based on the number of lanes, and these are visually differentiated in the graph.

## Features

- **Random City Generation**: 100 cities with unique names and random coordinates.
- **Road Types**: Roads are classified as:
  - **National Highways (4 lanes)**
  - **Inter-State Highways (3 lanes)**
  - **Highways (2 lanes)**
  - **Main Roads (1 lane)**
- **Connectivity**: Each city is connected to at least one other city.
- **Visualization**: The map is displayed using GraphStream, with different road types distinguished by color.

## Dependencies

- **GraphStream**: A dynamic graph library used for the visualization of the map.

### Customization

- **City Names**: Modify the `CITY_NAMES` array in the `Map` class to add or change city names.
- **Number of Cities**: Change the number of cities generated by modifying the argument passed to `generateCities()` in the `main` method.
- **Road Generation Logic**: Customize the `generateRoads()` method to change how roads are created and connected.

## Project Structure
- `Road.java`: Represents a road connecting two cities, including the number of lanes.
- `Map.java`: Manages the list of cities and roads, generates the map, and displays it using GraphStream.
